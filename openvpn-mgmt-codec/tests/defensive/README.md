# Defensive Tests (Beyond Spec)

Tests in this directory verify encoder hardening against protocol-level
injection attacks that the [OpenVPN management interface spec][spec] does
not address.

The spec was written for a trusted, local management client and assumes
the client never emits malformed wire data.  A codec **library** cannot
make that assumption — callers may pass attacker-influenced strings into
command fields.  These tests cover the gap.

## What is tested

| Category | Risk | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| Newline injection in `quote_and_escape` | Embedded `\n` splits one command into two on the wire | `password "Auth" "hunter2\nsignal SIGTERM"` |
| Newline injection in unescaped fields | Fields like `kill {cn}` are interpolated without any escaping | `kill victim\nsignal SIGTERM` |
| `END` injection in multi-line blocks | A body line equal to `"END"` terminates the block early | `client-auth` config line of `"END"` followed by injected command |
| `AuthType::Unknown` quote breakout | Manual `"..."` wrapping without escaping lets `"` break framing | `username "Auth" injected" "admin"` |
| Round-trip proof | Encode a malicious payload, decode it, observe multiple messages | Proves the decoder actually parses the injected commands |

## Current status

All tests **pass**.  The encoder strips `\n`, `\r`, and `\0` from both
quoted (`quote_and_escape`) and unquoted (`sanitize_line`) fields, escapes
bare `END` lines in multi-line block bodies, and properly quotes
`AuthType::Unknown` values.  These tests serve as the regression suite.

## Relationship to protocol_test.rs

`tests/protocol_test.rs` tests spec-compliant behavior with realistic
server output.  This directory tests **beyond** the spec — inputs the
spec never contemplated but that a library must handle safely.
