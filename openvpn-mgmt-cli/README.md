# openvpn-mgmt-cli

Interactive CLI for the OpenVPN management interface. Connects to a running
OpenVPN management socket and lets you send typed commands while printing
decoded messages in real time.

## Usage

```sh
cargo run -p openvpn-mgmt-cli -- 127.0.0.1:7505
cargo run -p openvpn-mgmt-cli -- /var/run/openvpn.sock   # Unix socket
cargo run -p openvpn-mgmt-cli -- --help
```

The address defaults to `127.0.0.1:7505` if omitted. On Unix, a path to a
Unix domain socket is also accepted.

## Commands

## Testing against a real OpenVPN instance

You can test the CLI against a real OpenVPN process without affecting your
network. The `--management-hold` flag makes OpenVPN open the management port
and pause before doing anything — no tunnel, no routing changes.

### Prerequisites

- OpenVPN installed (any recent version)
- Administrator / root privileges (OpenVPN requires them even with `dev null`)

### Quick start

Helper scripts in the repository root build the CLI, start OpenVPN in held
mode, connect the CLI, and clean up on exit:

```sh
# Linux / macOS (do NOT run the script itself under sudo — it uses sudo
# internally only for OpenVPN, so cargo/rustup remain available)
./test-mgmt.sh
./test-mgmt.sh /usr/sbin/openvpn   # explicit path

# Windows (elevated PowerShell)
.\test-mgmt.ps1
.\test-mgmt.ps1 -OpenVpnPath "D:\tools\openvpn\bin\openvpn.exe"
```

### Manual setup

1. Start OpenVPN with the included config:

   ```sh
   sudo openvpn --config test-mgmt.ovpn
   ```

2. In another terminal, connect the CLI:

   ```sh
   cargo run -p openvpn-mgmt-cli -- 127.0.0.1:7505
   ```

### Things to try

Once connected you'll see the `>INFO:` banner and a `>HOLD:` notification.

```text
ovpn> version          # read-only, always works
ovpn> help             # list all management commands
ovpn> status           # dump connection status
ovpn> pid              # show OpenVPN PID
ovpn> state on         # start streaming state notifications
ovpn> log on           # stream log output
ovpn> verb             # query current verbosity
ovpn> verb 5           # set verbosity
ovpn> bytecount 2      # byte-count notifications every 2s (zeros in hold)
ovpn> hold release     # let OpenVPN proceed (no remote, so it just idles)
ovpn> signal SIGUSR2   # dump stats to log
ovpn> hold on          # re-enable hold
ovpn> signal SIGUSR1   # soft restart back into held state
ovpn> quit             # disconnect
```

Since there is no `remote` directive in the test config, OpenVPN never connects anywhere.
Your internet stays untouched.
